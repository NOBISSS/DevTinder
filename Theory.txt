package.json vs package-lock.json


Orders are important in Routes


for testing our api's and route we use POSTMAN

Advance Routing Technique

app.get("/ab?c");
this means that the b is optional so even if you have routes like /abc or /ac it works

app.get("/ab+c");
this means you can add as many b you want
like /abc
     /abbbbc
     /abbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbc

app.get("/ab*cd");
this meand if you write anything between abcd it works even through
like /abcd -simple case
     /abPARTHCHAUHANcd -still work
     etc,..
in short it starts with ab and ends with cd

app.get("/a(bc)?d");
means bc is optional
and if you writing b you have to write c too

app.get(/a/)
if in the path a is exist it run
